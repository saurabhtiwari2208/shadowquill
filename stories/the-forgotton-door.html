        <p>Emma had lived in the old house on Elm Street for years, but there was one part of the house she never dared explore—the attic. The door was hidden behind an old wardrobe, cold and imposing. As a child, she’d always felt a strange unease around it, as if something, or someone, was trapped inside.</p>

        <p>After her parents passed, Emma moved back into the house, but she never touched the attic door. That is, until one evening when she returned home to find the wardrobe moved aside. The attic door was now wide open, beckoning her.</p>

        <p><strong>"Who moved this?"</strong> she whispered, her heart pounding.</p>

        <p>With trembling hands, she stepped toward the door. The air was thick with dust and something... ancient. She slowly ascended the stairs, each creak of the old wood echoing through the house. At the top of the stairs, she froze.</p>

        <p>In the far corner, there was a small, forgotten door—unlike anything she’d seen before. Dark wood, with strange, twisted symbols carved into it. Something pulled her toward it, despite the fear clawing at her chest.</p>

        <p><strong>"What is this?"</strong> she whispered, reaching out to touch the door. The moment her fingers brushed the cold wood, a voice filled the air, low and guttural.</p>

        <p><em>"You shouldn’t have come here."</em></p>

        <p>Emma’s blood ran cold. She whipped around, but the attic was empty, still. Her breath quickened, and the voice came again, louder, sharper.</p>

        <p><em>"You were always meant to find me."</em></p>

        <p>The door creaked open, revealing nothing but blackness beyond. A cold wind rushed out, as if the very darkness inside was alive, eager to swallow her whole.</p>

        <p><strong>"No… no!"</strong> she gasped, her feet frozen to the floor, but the shadows began to twist and writhe, pulling her toward the door.</p>

        <p><em>"You belong here now,"</em></p>
        <p><em>the voice whispered, as the darkness engulfed her.</em></p>

        <p>With a scream, she tried to escape, but it was too late. The door slammed shut behind her.</p>

        <p>The next morning, when the neighbors came by, they found the house silent. The attic door was wide open, but the small door was gone. Emma was nowhere to be found. The wardrobe was back in place, as if nothing had ever happened.</p>

        <p>And the house stood still, waiting, its hunger never sated, waiting for the next soul to open the forgotten door.</p>
